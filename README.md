# Github-Actions
This is the repository for generic and reusable github actions.
Due to the nature of reusable github workflows this repository **must** be public. All workflows stored within this repository should be as generic as possible while still fulfilling requirements.

## Starter Workflows
If you are starting out a new repo or want to update an existing one with a new workflow checkout the [starter workflows](/starters/README.md).
